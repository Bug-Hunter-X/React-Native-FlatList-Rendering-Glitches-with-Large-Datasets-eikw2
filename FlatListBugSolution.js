The solution involves several optimizations to improve the performance of the FlatList.  First, we'll use the `getItemLayout` prop to provide the FlatList with pre-calculated item dimensions, which allows for faster scrolling and reduces layout calculations.  Second, we'll adjust the `windowSize` to optimize the number of items rendered at a time. Finally, make sure each item has a unique `key` prop to prevent re-renders when data doesn't change.  Here's an example:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={data}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <ItemComponent item={item} key={item.id} />}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  getItemLayout={(data, index) => (
    {
      length: ITEM_HEIGHT,
      offset: ITEM_HEIGHT * index,
      index,
    }
  )}
  windowSize={10} // Adjust as needed
/>
```

Where `ITEM_HEIGHT` is a constant representing the height of each item.
